  abstract       = { The current generation of software transactional
                   memories has the advantage of being simple and
                   efficient. Nevertheless, there are several parameters
                   that affect the performance of a transactional memory,
                   for example the locality of the application and the
                   cache line size of the processor. In this paper, we
                   investigate dynamic tuning mechanisms on a new
                   time-based software transactional memory
                   implementation. We study in extensive measurements the
                   performance of our implementation and exhibit the
                   benefits of dynamic tuning. We compare our results with
                   TL2, which is currently one of the fastest word-based
                   software transactional memories. },

by allowing for parallel execution of atomic tasks.
Thus far, TM systems have focused on implementing transactional
state buffering and conflict resolution. Missing is a
robust hardware/software interface, not limited to simplistic
instructions defining transaction boundaries. Without
rich semantics, current TM systems cannot support basic
features of modern programming languages and operating
systems such as transparent library calls,...},
