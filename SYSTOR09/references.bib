  abstract       = { The current generation of software transactional
                   memories has the advantage of being simple and
                   efficient. Nevertheless, there are several parameters
                   that affect the performance of a transactional memory,
                   for example the locality of the application and the
                   cache line size of the processor. In this paper, we
                   investigate dynamic tuning mechanisms on a new
                   time-based software transactional memory
                   implementation. We study in extensive measurements the
                   performance of our implementation and exhibit the
                   benefits of dynamic tuning. We compare our results with
                   TL2, which is currently one of the fastest word-based
                   software transactional memories. },

                   semantics, current TM systems cannot support basic
                   features of modern programming languages and operating
                   systems such as transparent library calls,...},
